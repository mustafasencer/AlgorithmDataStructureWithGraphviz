    Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai).
    n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0).
    Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

    Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.
