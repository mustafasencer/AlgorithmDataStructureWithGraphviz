    Created by Mustafa Sencer Ã–zcan on 27.05.2020.

    Suppose an arrays sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

    (i.e.,  [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become  [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

    Find the minimum element.

    You may assume no duplicate exists in the arrays.
