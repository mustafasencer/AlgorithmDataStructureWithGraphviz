    Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

    (i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

    You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.

    You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

    Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).
